# FastAPI Template

This is a very customizable FastAPI template!

## Usage

First, you'll need to install [cookiecutter](https://pypi.org/project/cookiecutter/).

Then I invite you to run the following command:

``` bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/Kludex/fastapi-template
```

Configure what is needed, and you'll have your FastAPI application, ready to run! ðŸ™‚

In case you just want to do a quick check, add the `--no-input` argument:

``` bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/Kludex/fastapi-template --no-input
```
